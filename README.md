# Password Checker

This little application is put together to check any given password against the vast database at [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

It does not transmit the password from your computer as it uses a [k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity) model and only sends the first 5 bytes of encrypted data for comparison.
